## The Problem

In World of Warcraft Classic, the end-of-battleground honor display only shows honor gained from objectives. This means that all honorable kills (HKs) and their associated honor gains are not properly accounted for in the final scoreboard, making it difficult to track your true honor earnings.

## The Solution

GHonor provides real-time tracking of all honor sources during battlegrounds:
- Honorable kills and their honor value
- Objective completion honor
- Total honor earned

## Features

- Real-time honorable kill counter
- Dynamic honor tracking from kills
- Objective honor tracking
- Movable interface
- Automatic display in battlegrounds
- Accurate total honor calculation

## Commands

- `/ghonor show` - Show/Hide the window
- `/ghonor reset` - Reset window position

## Installation

1. Download the latest version from CurseForge
2. Extract the contents to your `World of Warcraft/_classic_era_/Interface/AddOns/` folder
3. Restart the game if necessary
